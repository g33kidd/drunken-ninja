This is currently a Work in Progress project that I'm working on. It will be an application framework built on the same principles as any other publishing platform, but more geared towards developers, users, and publishing in general.

I don't currently have a name for this project, but I assume it will come over time.

Planned Features
====

- User Management
- Plugin System for extending functionality
- Theming System
- Visual page editor/builder
- Visual style editor to modify CSS
- REST API
- Edit content in Markdown, HTML, or with Visual Editor.
- Live Preview pages
- more in the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/9cIara3V/drunken-ninja-roadmap)
